      STAR Education began its work in the 1980's, when greatly diminished resources for California 
      public schools and latchkey children emerged as two major challenges to child welfare. In 1986, 
      husband and wife team Katya and Erick Bozzi Sr. activated parents, professionals in partnership 
      with the 10th District PTA in their West LA community to address the critical need for safe, high 
      quality educational and enrichment opportunities for children.
      <br>
        <br>
      Together, they mobilized alternative and innovative resources to enhance youth education and 
      development, bolster the struggling public school in their community, and provide a safe and 
      supportive environment for children after school. STAR recognized the need to gather community 
      partners, universities, and local leaders to rally around their public schools to bring new 
      resources to help schools and school districts realize their educational goals. In 1993, 
      STAR Education was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 1997, Erick, Sr. and Katya Bozzi, and their children, Erick II and Katiana, founded the
       STAR Eco Station as a subsidiary of STAR Education in partnership with US Fish and Wildlife. 
       The STAR Eco Station is an environmental science museum and exotic wildlife rescue facility 
       in Culver City, Calif., where visitors have an opportunity to learn how they can be involved
        in the preservation of the planet and have the chance to interact with rescued endangered 
        and exotic wildlife. 
        <br>
        <br>
      What began over 25 years ago with two innovative parents, a handful of outstanding
       professionals from the community, and one elementary school in West Los Angeles has 
       been cultivated into a large-scale effort including over 1000 highly-skilled employees,
        as well as partnerships with government agencies, private organizations, parents and community
         groups. STAR's programs support and enhance school-day curriculum and broaden the amenities 
         that schools offer their communities, reinforcing the public school site as both the community
          focal point and as a center for state of the art learning.
          <br>
          <br>
      Today, STAR benefits over a million learners throughout California. Each day, STAR comes to school 
      campuses in over 60 school districts throughout California, Tennessee, and New York to connect students 
      to the lessons and the resources they need to become lifelong learners. Through the years, STAR has
       enabled and inspired students to attend major universities, choose exciting career paths, and do 
       meaningful work throughout the world.
